        "# Summarisation and Controlled Text Generation with T-5\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will see how to fine-tune one of the [HuggingFace Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) model (T5) for the summarisation task and the task of controlled text generation with keywords. We will use the [XSum dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08745.pdf) (for extreme summarisation) which contains long BBC articles and their single-sentence summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "[T5](https://paperswithcode.com/method/t5) is a popular model, which is designed as a text-to-text multi-task model. For each task, both input and output is text (so that for a regression task, a number 2.5 becomes a string \"2.5\"). Hence we can use the same model for a range of tasks including translation, linguistic acceptability, sentence similarity, document summarisation (our case), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will start by installing 🤗 Huggingface Transformers and 🤗 Huggingface Datasets as well as other dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Much of our code is based on the [official tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/summarization-tf.ipynb)."
